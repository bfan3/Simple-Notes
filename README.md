# Simple-Notes
# My first iOS app written in Objective-C

You can create and edit simple text-based notes. 
You can navigate and share data between multiple screens.
It saves data to the device's persistent storage. 
The app will also have easily discoverable command patterns to accept user input. So a simple plus button to add a new note, for example.
